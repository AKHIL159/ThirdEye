ThirdEye.py is the final program. It can simultaneously detect human faces and objects mentioned in '/resources/coco.names'

To recognise known and unknown faces, add an image file saved as the name of the person'yourName.png' to 'resources/images for code/'

object names in coco.names can be erased as needed to add/remove the object names which will be read aloud by the progam.
